# Pothole-Detection-using-ResNet-CNN

## Overview
This document presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting potholes in road images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on the ResNet50 model. The main objective is to develop a robust and accurate system for identifying potholes in road images, which can be useful for infrastructure maintenance and monitoring.

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset consists of road images divided into two categories: "Pothole" and "Plain". The images are resized to a fixed size of 256x256 pixels.
2. **Model Architecture**: The ResNet50 pre-trained model is used as the base model, and additional dense layers are added on top to perform the classification task.
3. **Training and Validation**: The model is trained using the prepared dataset, with a split between training and validation sets. The training is performed for 50 epochs with a batch size of 128.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set, and the performance metrics, such as accuracy, are reported.

## Findings and Conclusions
1. The ResNet-based CNN model achieves high accuracy in classifying road images as either "Pothole" or "Plain", demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting potholes.
2. The model shows robust performance, with the training and validation accuracy converging to 100% and 90%, respectively, within the first few epochs.
3. The model is able to correctly identify potholes in the test set, with the predictions aligning with the ground truth labels.
4. The use of a pre-trained ResNet50 model as the base architecture, along with the additional dense layers, proves to be a successful approach for this pothole detection task.

Overall, this work presents a promising deep learning-based solution for automated pothole detection, which can be valuable for infrastructure maintenance and monitoring applications.
